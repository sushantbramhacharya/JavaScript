Js is Single Threaded Programming Language

Execution Context
1.Global Execution Context
2.Function Execution Context
3.Eval Execution Context (Used in Mongoose)

Phases
1.Memory Creation Phase(Allocate Memory for variables objects etc)
2.Execution Phase

Example
------------------
let v1=10
let v2=5
function add(n1,n2)
{
    let total=n1+n2
    return total
}
let res1=add(v1,v2)
let res2=add(10,20)
------------------
1.Global Execution
= allocates this compulsary

2.Mermory Creation Phase
= Gathers all the variables and stores
= v1->undefined
= v2->undefined
add->defination
= res1->undefined
= res2->undefined

3.Execution Phase
= val1<-10
= val2<-5
= nothing in defination of function
= res1->(new variable environmetn + Execution thread) New Executional = Context does all the phases for this specific function deletes after use
        = 2.Mermory Creation Phase
        = Gathers all the variables and stores
        = n1->undefined
        = n2->undefined
        = total->undefined

        = 2.Mermory Creation Phase
        = Gathers all the variables and stores
        = n1->10
        = n2->5
        = total->15

        = 3.Destorys and returns

Same Thing goes on-------------------------------------


Call Stack
= when func exectues gets pushed in call stack and popped affter Execution
